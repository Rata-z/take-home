## Testing Approach

I think that, even for simple features, writing a few unit and integration tests can be valuable in the long run.
For unit tests, I would focus primarily on testing store actions by mocking the store and writing assertions (using tools like Jest or React Testing Library).
For integration tests, the main goal would be to verify that the card buttons correctly update the store.

Since small features tend to change frequently, it's important to maintain and update these tests regularly to keep them relevant and effective.
